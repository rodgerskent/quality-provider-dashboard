## Quality Dining Dashboard 
Built a web application to assist Colorado residents in avoiding restaurants that have performed poorly by violating local food handling requirements. The application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Plotly, D3 and Mapbox. Key dashboard features are:
* []()Extracted restaurant inspection data published by the Tri-County Health Department
* []()Make the restaurant inspection data available by city as selected by the user
* []()Summarize restaurant performance based on the number of restaurant inspection violations and the type of establishment they are
* []()Visually present results in a histogram based on number of violations and in a pie charge by establishment type
* []()List the restaurants with a high number of foodborne inspection violations, branded the "List of Shame"
* []()Users may review the detailed inspection violations by selecting a restaurant of interest from the “List of Shame” drop down menu.
* []()All restaurants in a user selection are mapped and have a tooltip that includes the address for easy location (or avoidance)

## Key Insights
The following key insights were brought to life in the assessment.
* []()Only 18% of restaurant inspections resulted in zero violations
* []()85% of restaurants had less than six (6) violations, likewise, 15% had six (6) or more violations
* []()Dashboard interest and engagement was higher than expected. Each user generally has a restaurant that they are familiar with that has a high number of violations.
* []()Personally, I was surprised to see family favorite, Golden Shanghai, on the "List of Shame"
